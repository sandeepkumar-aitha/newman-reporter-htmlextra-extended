This is forked from [Newman Reporter htmlextra](https://github.com/DannyDainton/newman-reporter-htmlextra). This package have 3 more extra features
1. Changed color for skipped cases from bg-success to bg-warning and changed badge color to badge-danger.
2. Introduced iteration names, By default existing report shows numbers but if we have multiple iteration and report user can't differentiate difference.
3. Introduced Scenario Numbering, If consecutive request names are same then "Scenario <number>" will be appendeding at the end. As of now implemented in "Total Requests" tab.

A [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) HTML reporter that has been extended to include the separation of the iteration runs so these are no longer aggregated together and also some additional `handlebars helpers` to enable users to create better custom templates. 

This reporter comes with a dashboard style summary landing page and a set of different tabs which contain the detailed request information. There are also a few optional configuration flags available, to tailor the final report in a number of different ways.

## Interactive Example Report

To give you an idea of what the final report will look like, I've added a working example here for you to get your hands on:

## Install

> The reporter works as a plugin with [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) so ensure that you have already installed that package globally, using `npm install -g newman`.

To `globally` install the `htmlextra` package:

```console
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra-extended
```

To use `htmlextra` as a library, install the package as a dependency into a `nodejs` project's `package.json` file using:

```console
npm install -S newman-reporter-htmlextra-extended
```

To install `node`, `newman` and the `htmlextra` packages together, use this command to pull the `Docker` image:

```console
docker pull dannydainton/htmlextra
```

---

## Usage

In order to enable this reporter, specify `htmlextra-extended` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option. The following command will create a new report in the `./newman` directory, if the directory does not exist, it will be created as part of the Newman run.

```console
newman run collection.json -r htmlextra-extended-extended
```

#### With Newman as a Library

All the CLI functionality is available for programmatic use within a `nodejs` script.

Creating a very basic `nodejs` project can be done like this:

- Create a new directory using `mkdir <new dir name>`
- Move to the new directory using `cd <new dir name>`
- Create a `package.json` file using `npm init -y`
- Install the required node modules using `npm i -S newman newman-reporter-htmlextra`
- Create a new `<filename>.js` file and add the script below which contains the current list of reporter options
- Add your `collection.json` file reference to the script and run using `node <filename>.js`

Once the node script has run, the report will be created in the default `./newman` directory. A new save location can be specified using the `export` flag. 

To enable the functionality of a given feature, uncomment any of the options within the `htmlextra` object. 

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: './pathToFile/collection.json', // Collection URL from a public link or the Postman API can also be used
    reporters: ['htmlextra-extended'],
    iterationCount: 1,
    reporter: {
        "htmlextra-extended": {
            // export: './report.html',
            // template: './template.hbs'
            // logs: true,
            // showOnlyFails: true,
            // noSyntaxHighlighting: true,
            // testPaging: true,
            // browserTitle: "My Newman report",
            // title: "My Newman Report",
            // titleSize: 4,
            // omitHeaders: true,
            // skipHeaders: "Authorization",
            // omitRequestBodies: true,
            // omitResponseBodies: true,
            // hideRequestBody: ["Login"],
            // hideResponseBody: ["Auth Request"],
            // showEnvironmentData: true,
            // skipEnvironmentVars: ["API_KEY"],
            // showGlobalData: true,
            // skipGlobalVars: ["API_TOKEN"],
            // skipSensitiveData: true,
            // showMarkdownLinks: true,
            // showFolderDescription: true,
            // timezone: "Australia/Sydney",
            // skipFolders: "folder name with space,folderWithoutSpace",
            // skipRequests: "request name with space,requestNameWithoutSpace",
            // displayProgressBar: true,
            // iterationNames: ["QA", "Integration"],
            //scenarioNumbering: true
        }
    }
});
```

#### Running The Reporter With Docker

A docker image `dannydainton/htmlextra` has been created for the reporter and can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dannydainton/htmlextra)

#### Basic Usage

Using this command, it will pull down the image and run the Postman Collection with Newman. Once the run has completed it will create a new report file in the `/newman` dir.

```console
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/etc/newman dannydainton/htmlextra run collection.json -r htmlextra-extended
```

Using an environment file during the Newman run:

```console
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/etc/newman dannydainton/htmlextra run collection.json -e environment.json -r htmlextra-extended
```

Using either the Shared Collection link from the Postman App or using the Postman API Link to the files:

```console
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/etc/newman dannydainton/htmlextra run <URL to Collection> -e <URL to Environment> -r htmlextra-extended
```

Each of these command can be used with the different CLI flags to create the final report that you require.

## Special mention

This work have been hugely inspired and copied several aspects of the great work done by [Martijn Vander Vlag](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag) to create the [newman-reporter-htmlfull](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag/newman-reporter-htmlfull) package. Check out that package too, this contains many of the same aggregation features.

It was also brought together by reviewing the feature requests, from the official [Postman HTML reporter](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman-reporter-html) and implementing them into this reporter.
